Bunch-It developed for my senior project and nominated to beest senior. It is a clustering search engine that visualize clusters with a GraphMap - developed by myself - or a TagCloud. All the codes are inside the respo. Please feel free to use it anywhere with a little notice to me :).  www.erengolge.com www.bunch-it.com
